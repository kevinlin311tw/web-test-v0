                    <h3>1970s: Founding and Early Vision</h3>
                    <p>Microsoft was founded on April 4, 1975 by childhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The pair started the company (originally "Micro-Soft") to develop a BASIC interpreter for the MITS Altair 8800, an early personal computer.</p>
                    <p>This first product, Altair BASIC, became Microsoft's entry into the personal computing revolution. From the beginning, Gates and Allen dreamed big – envisioning "a computer on every desk and in every home," a bold mission that set the tone for Microsoft's future.</p>
                    <p>In 1979, Microsoft moved its growing operations to the Seattle area (Bellevue, Washington) to be closer to the heart of the tech industry. By the end of the 1970s, the company had laid the groundwork for the PC software era with a small but passionate team and a vision that would transform computing.</p>

                    <h3>1980s: MS-DOS, Windows Debut, and Going Public</h3>
                    <p>In 1980, Microsoft's partnership with IBM on the IBM PC solidified its role in the industry. IBM's first PC, released in August 1981, came with Microsoft's 16-bit operating system, MS-DOS 1.0, marking Microsoft's software as the brains of millions of new personal computers.</p>
                    <p>This propelled Microsoft to prominence as a key player in the PC boom. Building on MS-DOS, Microsoft introduced the first version of Windows in 1985, bringing a graphical user interface to the PC platform.</p>
                    <p>The company's growth accelerated, and on March 13, 1986, Microsoft went public in a successful IPO, an event that would fuel its expansion in the years to come. By the late 1980s, Microsoft was not only an operating system powerhouse but also expanding into productivity software – 1989 saw the release of the first version of Microsoft Office, bundling Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into a suite that foreshadowed Microsoft's dominance in business applications.</p>
                    <p>An aerial photo of the rapidly expanding Redmond campus in 1989 underscored the company's tremendous growth during the decade. By 1990, Microsoft had become the world's largest PC software company, setting the stage for its 1990s dominance.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The 1990s were the decade when Microsoft became a household name worldwide. In 1990, Windows 3.0 was released, offering an improved graphical interface and the popular Solitaire game – this release greatly broadened the PC's appeal.</p>
                    <p>Microsoft's software soon ran on the majority of personal computers, and the company's flagship products became ubiquitous at home and in the office. The launch of Windows 95 on August 24, 1995 was a cultural phenomenon – complete with a global marketing blitz – and introduced features like the Start button that defined the PC experience.</p>
                    <p>That same year, Bill Gates issued his famous "Internet Tidal Wave" memo, recognizing the transformative power of the emerging internet and pivoting Microsoft to embrace web technology. Throughout the '90s, the Office suite (Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and more) solidified its position as the essential productivity toolkit for businesses and consumers, after its first release in 1989.</p>
                    <p>Microsoft also entered the web browser wars with Internet Explorer in 1995, integrating it into Windows. By the end of the decade, with products like Windows 98 (launched in 1998) continuing the refinement of the PC platform, Microsoft was the undisputed leader in desktop software, powering the computing experiences of hundreds of millions of users around the globe.</p>

                    <h3>2000s: New Leadership and New Ventures</h3>
                    <p>The new millennium brought leadership changes and broadened horizons for Microsoft. In January 2000, Steve Ballmer – one of Microsoft's earliest employees – succeeded Bill Gates as CEO, becoming the company's second chief executive.</p>
                    <p>Under Ballmer's energetic leadership, Microsoft entered new markets while continuing to dominate in operating systems and productivity software. Windows XP, released in 2001, became one of Microsoft's most successful operating systems, renowned for its stability and user-friendliness.</p>
                    <p>That same year, Microsoft made a bold move beyond the PC: it launched the Xbox on November 15, 2001, entering the video game console market. The Xbox brought Microsoft into living rooms as an entertainment brand, eventually building a huge community of gamers (with innovations like the Xbox Live online service).</p>
                    <p>Throughout the 2000s, Microsoft also expanded its enterprise software lineup – introducing the .NET development framework and server products – to serve the needs of businesses. In 2007, Microsoft released Windows Vista and Office 2007, which, despite mixed reception for Vista, demonstrated the company's continual push to innovate its core platforms.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, Bill Gates gradually stepped back from day-to-day operations, transitioning in June 2008 to focus more on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. By the end of the decade, Microsoft launched Bing (2009) as a "decision engine" to compete in web search, and Windows 7 (also 2009) restored Windows' reputation with a highly praised, fast and modern OS.</p>
                    <p>The 2000s were marked by Microsoft's diversification – from gaming to internet services – and immense financial growth, as the company's annual revenue and global presence soared.</p>
